                <h3>Benefits of turmeric: a popular ayurvedic remedy</h3>
                <p>Turmeric, the spice that gives curry its characteristic yellow color, is another popular Ayurvedic remedy.

                    Curcumin, its main active compound, has powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Test-tube research shows that it may be equally or even more effective than some anti-inflammatory drugs â€” without all of their side effects.
                    
                    Also, turmeric may help protect against heart disease, in part by improving blood flow as effectively as exercise or certain pharmaceutical drugs.
